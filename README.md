# Federated Learning for Personalized Treatment Recommendations in Mental Health

## Project Overview

This project implements a federated learning system to generate personalized treatment recommendations for mental health conditions. By leveraging federated learning, we can train machine learning models on decentralized data from multiple healthcare providers while preserving patient privacy.

## Features

- Federated learning framework for training models across multiple data sources
- Privacy-preserving data handling and model aggregation
- Personalized treatment recommendation system for mental health conditions
- Support for various mental health disorders and treatment modalities
- Performance evaluation metrics for model accuracy and recommendation quality

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- PySyft 0.5+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask (for API server)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/CosmicPegasus07/Fedrated-Learning.git
cd Fedrated-Learning.git

2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
- Organize patient data into separate files for each healthcare provider
- Ensure data is anonymized and follows the required format (see `data/sample_data.csv`)

2. Configure the federated learning setup:
- Adjust parameters in `config.yml` to set number of rounds, learning rate, etc.

3. Run the federated learning process:

python run_federated_learning.py

4. Evaluate the model:

python evaluate_model.py

5. Start the recommendation API server:

python api_server.py

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Each healthcare provider prepares their patient data, including features like demographics, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment outcomes.

2. **Federated Learning**: The system initiates a federated learning process where:
   - A global model is initialized
   - Each provider trains the model on their local data
   - Model updates are aggregated securely without sharing raw data
   - The process repeats for multiple rounds to improve the global model

3. **Personalization**: The global model is fine-tuned for individual patients using their specific data.

4. **Treatment Recommendations**: The personalized model generates treatment recommendations based on patient characteristics and historical outcomes.

5. **Continuous Learning**: As new data becomes available, the system can update the global and personalized models to improve recommendations over time.
