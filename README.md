# Timeless Reconstruction: Artifact Restoration Using Generative Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview

This project focuses on restoring historical artifacts and manuscripts using cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence techniques. By leveraging deep learning and generative models, we aim to reconstruct damaged or missing parts of artifacts, bringing timeless history back to life.

## Features

- Generative AI-based artifact restoration using advanced models like GANs and diffusion models
- Pretrained models for various artifact categories (e.g., manuscripts, sculptures, paintings)
- Support for training on custom datasets
- Visualization tools for comparing original and restored artifacts
- Scalable architecture for adding new restoration techniques

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Flask (for API server)
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Timeless-Reconstruction.git
   cd Timeless-Reconstruction

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Prepare your data:
   - Place damaged artifact images in the data/input folder.
   - Ensure images are in `.jpg` or `.png` format and meet the input resolution requirements.

2. Configure the restoration parameters:
   - Modify `config.yml` to set model type, restoration options, and training parameters.

3. Perform artifact restoration:
   
   ```bash
   python run_restoration.py

4. Evaluate restoration results:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_results.py

5. Start the API server for real-time restoration:

   ```bash
   python api_server.py

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Input images of damaged artifacts are preprocessed for compatibility with restoration models.

2. **Generative Modeling**: 
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models reconstruct damaged or missing regions.
   - Models are pre-trained on datasets of historical artifacts and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases.

3. **Restoration Process**:
   - Input images undergo preprocessing for normalization and artifact segmentation.
   - The restoration model generates the reconstructed artifact.
   - Post-processing ensures that restored artifacts maintain historical accuracy and visual quality.
  
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual similarity are used to assess the quality of restorations.

5. **Real-Time API**: The Flask API allows users to instantly upload images and receive restored versions.
